# CUDA-2D-Steady-State-Heat-Conduction
This program uses CUDA to determine the steady state heat distribution 
in a thin metal plate using synchronous iteration on a GPU. Using the finite difference method
to solve Laplace's equation.

# Thin Plate Set Up
A perfectly insulted thin plate with the sides held at 20 °C and a short segment on one side is 
held at 100 °C is shown below<br />
